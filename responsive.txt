Make all your containers flex... 
Keep all small objects in flex containers... 
Set flex-wrap to wrap... 
Set min-height, max-height and min-width, max-width... 
Set as many values as you can in rem, em and %. Avoid using px... 
Create media queries for flex-direction and font sizes... 
And you are done...
