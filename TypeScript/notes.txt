why typescript?
- lesser runtime errors
- helps to work with entities
- browser can't directly run typescript. it needs to be transpiled in JS

# to compile TS to JS (with watch flag) -> tsc <filename> -w
  OR, make a tsconfig.json file and include -> "compilerOptions": {
                                                    "rootDir": "./src",
                                                    "outDir": "./dist"
                                                }
    and put all .ts files in src and run -> tsc -w -> all js files will be generated in dist folder
