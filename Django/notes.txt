# MVT(Model View Template) Architecture

# - models are similar to tables in database
  - make models in your apps and register them in admin file
  - copy the class name from apps.py (Here, HomeConfig) and paste 'home.apps.HomeConfig' in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
  - after any changes in model
    > python manage.py makemigrations -> create changes and store in a file
    > python manage.py migrate -> apply the changes

# Running queries using django ORM > python manage.py shell
  example queries:
  > from home.module import Contact
  > Contact.objects.all() // returns all contact objects
  > Contact.objects.all()[0].email // get email of first contact object
  > Contact.objects.filter(email="aniket@gmail.com", phone="23432423") // to filter objects with conditions [, means and]
  
  > instance = Contact.objects.filter(phone="989023432")[0]
  > instance.email = "abc@gmail.com"
  > instance

  > Contact.objects.filter(desc__startswith="this is")
