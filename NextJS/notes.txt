NextJS
- react frontend development web framework by Vercel
- enables functionality such as server-side rendering & static site generation
- Unlike traditional react app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client, 
  NextJS allows the first page load to be rendered by the server, which is great for SEO  & performance.

# You can't import the globals.css directly into any component(except _app.js), any component's css must have .module.css extension
# No need of router, simply put components in the pages folder
# make a separate components folder, components that don't have to route will be in this folder else in pages folder
# Convention - use lowercase for pages and Upper case(first letter) for other components

# 3 methods to fetch data - getStaticProps : fetch at build time 
                          - getServersideProps : fetch data on every request (slow)
                          - getStaticPaths : dynamically generate paths based on data we are fetching
